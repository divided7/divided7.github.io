<div style="text-align: justify;">The invention discloses a visible light positioning method and system for adaptive flower pollination based on reverse learning. Including step 1, positioning; Step 1.1 Visible light positioning; The LED is installed on the ceiling h meters above the ground; The mobile end is placed at any position on the ground, PD is installed on the mobile end as a receiver, and the LED, mobile end and PD are marked respectively. Step 1.2 Locate RSSI. Step 2. Flower pollination positioning; Step 2.1 Improve the pollination localization algorithm; Step 2.2 Population initialization based on reverse learning strategy. The invention has the advantages of higher positioning accuracy, faster calculation speed, stable positioning algorithm, etc.</div>
